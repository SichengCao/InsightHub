However, there are concerns raised about the limited access to private clubs, the USGA's preference for private courses, lack of variety in course rotation, inconsistent support for public courses, and the perceived elitism in the golf community.

Truthfully I never think about it as all these young men treat my daughters so well . This is what we want . I do have to say that every so often they will show up at the round early and pay my way . I do appreciate it but it’s really not about the money . For me it’s about being with the men who I know will take care of my daughters  when I no  longer can enjoy a round of golf .  This is the gift that we want .  My “ boys “ are good guys and will surprise me and my wife with dinner etc.  all of them including my daughters all just chipped in and sent my wife and I away for a long weekend .  Truly amazing .  Just be you ….pick up a coffee , a drink etc and just show your appreciation.  Your girlfriend’s dad just wants his daughter to be respected and loved .  As dads …our biggest concern is who will love our daughters as much as we do .  This is the biggest payback you could ever give him .",

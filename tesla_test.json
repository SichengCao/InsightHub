    "detailed_summary": "The Tesla Model Y receives praise for its quick acceleration, surpassing even some sports cars depending on the trim level, along with a long range that satisfies most users. Additionally, the vehicle is noted for its low cost maintenance, superior tech features, and solid standard driver assist capabilities. However, some users acknowledge that the Model Y may not excel in every single aspect and that the 3rd row seating could be cramped compared to other vehicles. While it is considered a very good all-rounder for a reasonable price, it may not be the absolute best option for every scenario."

      "text": "MotorTrend doesn’t get how a jack of all trades is the most popular car on earth? It’s a family hauler that accelerates quicker than most sports cars (depending on trim level) and has a range long enough to satisfy most while having low cost maintenance, superior tech, solid driver assist standard tech, great overall standard features, exceptional safety, and a platform that receives continuous software updates allowing the car to feel fresh years after ownership.  I have my issues with Tesla but MotorTrend is turning into a pile of waste.",

As the kids grew up we **referred to the 3rd row as the penalty box**. I'm guessing spacious by comparison. **EDIT bolded**\n\n**Lest the fanboys lose control and imagine the 'unmatched innovation and efficiency of Tesla', the 2003 Honda Pilot was ABOUT THE SAME LENGTH as the current 2 row Model Y. Temper your enthusiasm as facts are stubborn things. To add insult, the Pilots weighed 100-300 pounds LESS than a SOTA current Model Y.**",
